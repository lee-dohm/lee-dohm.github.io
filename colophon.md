# Colophon

> **noun.** a statement at the end of a book, typically with a printer's emblem, giving information about its authorship and printing.

Why yes, it does seem rather hipster of me to include a colophon on my blog. On the other hand, the colophon at the end of [O'Reilly][oreilly] books was always something that interested me and seemed cool. So, here's mine ...

I use [Jekyll][jekyll], the blog-aware static site generator, to generate the content of the site from a bunch of text files.[^text-files]

I write all of the articles in [Atom][atom] and publish them via [Git][git] to [GitHub Pages][pages]. I write everything on my [27" 2019 Retina iMac][imac] running [macOS][macos]. I use [various][varmilo] [keyboards][ergodox] (typically with [Gateron Blue keyswitches][gateron-blue]) for all my typing.

I'm using [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] for the theme of the site. The top navigation bar style was generated from the [Twitter Bootstrap 3 Navbar Generator][generator]. I chose [TARDIS Blue][tardis-blue] and white as my colors for it.

All of the source code for the site is available on [GitHub][source].

[^text-files]: Although, the content of the site, with the exception of a very few images, is just a bunch of text files anyway. So really, it just converts a bunch of text files of one type into a bunch of text files of another type. I'm going to stop talking now before I suck all the magic out of it.
