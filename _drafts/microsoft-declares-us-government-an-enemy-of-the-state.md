title: Microsoft Declares US Government an Enemy of the State

I'm talking about [this blog post][protecting] titled, "Protecting customer data from government snooping", by Brad Smith, Microsoft General Counsel and Executive Vice President of Legal and Corporate Affairs or, in English, Microsoft's head lawyer. Now, my title is much more sensationalist than Microsoft's surprisingly acerbic one but I still believe it to be accurate. Microsoft has stated that it is taking concrete steps to protect its customers' data from both technological and legal access without the customer's knowledge.
