  <p>Back in March, I wrote a post about <a href="/2011/03/27/the-ultimate-set-top-box.html">The Ultimate Set-Top Box</a>.  I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately and the fact that I just don’t watch much cable TV anymore.  Sure, when I’m bored I occasionally flip through the things on my TiVo, but it wouldn’t be any huge hardship to choose something else like reading a book, playing a video game or working on a programming hobby project.  So the question is … how much extra am I spending on a cable subscription that I don’t need?</p>

<p>I did some research.  Actually, I did some digging because Frontier Communications made it very hard to find out this information.  I tried going through their website via my account to see if I could change my plan.  They would not allow me to deselect TV from my current plan.  I could add or upgrade services, but I could not remove anything.  I finally had to resort to logging into their website as a new customer and look up the currently available plans that way.  Still, they didn’t make it easy because of the dizzying array of choices available.  But I was able to finally select just FIOS Internet without TV, without Home Phone, at my current speed rating.  Making this change would save me $30 per month.  It also turns out that the next <strong>higher</strong> speed rating might save me an additional $10 per month.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a> recently pointed out in a podcast, $40 per month can buy a lot of TV or movies on iTunes (or Amazon or Hulu or [insert your favorite video service here]).  Approximately thirty dollars will buy you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RK6EU8/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true">a full thirteen-episode season of Doctor Who in HD</a> from Amazon Video-on-Demand.  A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043U5TEK/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true">full season of House in HD</a> will run you about $56.  iTunes runs slightly more at $37 and $60, respectively.  Remember, these are HD videos that are yours to keep (so long as the DRM continues to be supported) with no commercials or other claptrap getting in the way.  $40 per month is $480 per year or eight full American-style seasons in HD.  So I could still have the shows that I really do want to watch, in a format that may allow me more freedom to watch when, how and on which device I want to watch it, and possibly still save me money.</p>

<p>Now I just need to figure out how to break the news to my daughter …</p>
