My latest keyboard experiment is by the same group that made the [Infinity ErgoDox keyboard](/2016/06/03/ergodox-keyboard/) I talked about a while back. It is called the [Infinity 60% Keyboard](https://input.club/devices/infinity-keyboard). There are three commonly-accepted sizes of keyboards for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts:

* Full-size - the typical 104-key layout with the main keyboard, F-keys, full-sized arrow and navigation keys and a numeric keypad
* [Tenkeyless](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Tenkeyless_keyboard) - This is the same as the full size keyboard but the section containing the numeric keypad chopped off
* [60%](https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25) - a layout with just the main keyboard and nothing else, not even F-keys

There are plenty of other less common layouts and there are even variations in categories, but these are the main ones. Here's a picture of my 60% keyboard:

What keyboard enthusiasts like about the smaller keyboards vary from person to person, but common reasons I've heard are:

* Smaller keyboards take up less desk space
* Getting rid of the extra keys is more efficient because it forces you to use more key combinations so your hands move less
* It's challenging and fun to learn new keyboard layouts
* Smaller keyboards can be taken traveling more easily meaning that [one never has to type on an inferior keyboard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenteinum/27920424870)

I wasn't interested in the Infinity 60% for the challenge or even necessarily the small size. I liked the idea of it because it, like the ErgoDox, is fully programmable. I can completely rework the way the keyboard operates and even create special functions or macros. For example, when I hold down the Caps Lock key, the blue, green, orange, and red buttons in the upper right become media keys: Mute, Play/Pause, Volume Down, and Volume Up respectively. This way, I can make the keyboard work best for me ... not conform myself to the keyboard.

And yeah, I may try out the keyboard on the road the next time I go traveling ...
