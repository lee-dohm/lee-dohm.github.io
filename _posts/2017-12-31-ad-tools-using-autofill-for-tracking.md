According to [this article](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/12/30/16829804/browser-password-manager-adthink-princeton-research), there are tools being used to track you by triggering the autofill features of your browser. The ad brokers have built these systems to do this in the background where you don't even know it is happening. According to the article, it is only attempting to trigger your username from the password manager built in to your browser, but there's nothing stopping them from using the same technique to trigger your password, your address, or anything else that you have set up to autofill in forms.

Here's how to turn off Autofill in all the major browsers:

1. Select the Settings menu
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Advanced"
1. Scroll to the "Passwords and forms" section
1. Click "Autofill settings"
1. Ensure the first item says "Off"
