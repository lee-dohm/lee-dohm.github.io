If you haven't heard about [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) yet, you should take the time to check it out soon.  Kickstarter is a [crowd-sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) [angel investorish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor) system that anyone can get in on.  The idea is that if you have a project or product or something that you want to launch but don't have the money for, you post the idea on Kickstarter and ask if people want to invest in your idea.  You give a goal of a certain amount of money by a certain date and if enough people invest in your idea to where you reach the goal in the time allotted, your project gets funded.  It's a great system that has funded a lot of cool new businesses.

The reason why I think it could be a boon to wargaming is that a little company calling itself [Tectonic Craft Studios](http://tectoniccraftstudios.com/) has already [used Kickstarter to fund its idea](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101466427/tectonic-craft-studios-new-line-of-war-games-terra) of making a new line of wargaming terrain.  All they asked for was eight thousand US dollars, but the Kickstarter community put together over $40,000 for them!  I hope that they are able to take this start and make a great business out of it.

What other ideas are out there in the wargaming community where the creativity and the initiative has always been there ... but the money to get started has never materialized?
