> However, in a filing on Thursday, Google revealed one of the few emails that they have been able to get access to so far, and it's stunning. It's an email between the MPAA and two of [the Mississippi Attorney General's] top lawyers ... discussing the big plan to "hurt" Google. Beyond influencing other Attorneys General (using misleading fake "setups" of searches for "bad" material) and paying for fake anti-Google research, the lawyers from Hood's office flat out admit that they're expecting the MPAA and the major studios to have its media arms run a coordinated propaganda campaign of bogus anti-Google stories

When it was said during the financial crisis that the banks were "too big to fail", I thought the solution was simple. I thought that we should put laws in place that banks aren't allowed to get anywhere near that big again. That the country's wealth should not be allowed to accumulate in so few hands. It's so obvious that people say it all the time, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." Isn't that what financiers are telling people all the time? Diversify!

Now, I am beginning to believe that the same is true of any kind of power, where financial power is just one kind. The accumulation of great power in few hands is something that the framers of the Constitution of the United States were understandably wary about. That's why they separated the powers between the branches of government. That's why they created a bicameral system for Congress. But whereas in their time, the great powers were governmental, in our time the great powers are corporate. And we can't trust the free market to keep power from accumulating ... because the whole purpose of business is to consolidate wealth ... and therefore power.
