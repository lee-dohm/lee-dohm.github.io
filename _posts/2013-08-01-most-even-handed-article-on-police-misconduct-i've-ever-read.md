The war over common citizens taking pictures or recording video of police rages on. A reporter for Seattle's [The Stranger][stranger] was [threatened with arrest][misconduct] for observing, taking pictures of police and asking questions on the legality or illegality of standing on public property. The best part about the article, I think, is that it doesn't try to make the incident any more than it is, a minor issue. In addition though, it does rightly point out that it is a minor issue indicative of a larger pattern that Seattle Police Department has already been [investigated for at a federal level][investigation].
