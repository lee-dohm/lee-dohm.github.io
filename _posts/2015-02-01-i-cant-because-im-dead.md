It looks like I wasn't the only person who reacted extremely negatively to the Nationwide Insurance commercial with the reveal that the cute kid talking in the commercial would never grow up ... because he's dead. I wonder if this "shock and awe" trend in SuperBowl commercials will have a negative impact on viewership next year?
