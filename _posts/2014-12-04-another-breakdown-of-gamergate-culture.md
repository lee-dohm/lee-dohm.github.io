I just read [another great analysis of GamerGate][gamergate], how its culture was shaped by the online communities in which it started and how this prevents any meaningful discourse. It really deserves a read, but I'll summarize it down to: You can't negotiate, debate, argue or even have a meaningful discussion with a mob that has no structure. And the individuals that make up the mob find it insulting when you refuse to waste your time.
