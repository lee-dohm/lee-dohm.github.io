I've been a long-time reader of [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) and even been an [Enforcer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer) at [PAX](http://paxsite.com) for the first six years of its existence.  I have a ton of respect for the folks behind Penny Arcade including Mike Krahulik, Jerry Holkins and Robert Khoo among others.  Today, [Mike tweeted](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/164146574606340096), "... Gamestop is a greedy fat cat that didn't do shit."  I have very specifically taken this quote out of context because I find the comment itself interesting as an indication just how much the Internet has changed things in our world.

When I was younger, the supply chain behind bringing a good (as opposed to a service) to market was pretty much assumed to be: manufacturer, distributor/wholesaler, retailer and customer.  Each step in the chain provided some benefit to the customer.  The manufacturer created the good.  The distributor or wholesaler was good at getting a certain class of goods from various manufacturers to tons of locations around the country or the world.  The retailer provided a clean, stable, safe and (sometimes) knowledgeable environment from which you could inspect, sample and purchase the good.  I would not have known about a great many computer games in my youth had my local [Egghead Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egghead_Software) not stocked them.

The role of the retailer has certainly changed significantly in the last few decades.
