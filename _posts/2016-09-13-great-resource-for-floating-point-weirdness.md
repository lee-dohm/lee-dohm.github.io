Recommended by my coworker, @ihavenotea, this is a great site that endeavors to explain floating point numbers, why they're used and their general pitfalls in clear terms. I especially like the language-specific reference section that lists ups and downs of floating point numbers in popular languages. And it's [open source](https://github.com/brazzy/floating-point-gui.de)!
