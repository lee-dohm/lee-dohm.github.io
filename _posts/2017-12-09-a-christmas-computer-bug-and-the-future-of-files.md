I enjoy [Tom Scott's videos][tom-scott]. He's got a great way of looking at things and is very talented at spelling things out so that everyone can understand. I just stumbled on the above-linked video and thought it was interesting that he came to the same conclusions [that I did several years back][files-are-an-implementation-detail].

He explains it much better than I did, of course ðŸ˜†
