> Perhaps the best summary I've ever heard that applies to the uproar in geek culture as a whole came from one of my coworkers. He asked me what Gamergate was all about, and after I explained, he paused for a moment, digesting what I'd said. Then: "So...it's like a restaurant that always serves chicken decides to add some salad to its menu and people freak out because they think the chicken will go away."

I think this is the first article about GamerGate that made me sad about all the horrible things that GamerGate stands for ***and*** makes me hopeful for the future. It even makes me a little sad that I'm not younger that I won't get to enjoy the truly inclusive geek culture that will hopefully come out of all of this upheaval.

Truly worth the read.
