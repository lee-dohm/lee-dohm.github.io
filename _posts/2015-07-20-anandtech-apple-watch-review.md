I haven't made it through the entire review, but [AnandTech](http://www.anandtech.com) is always insightful and thorough.

> Overall, Apple has pretty much nailed the design of the watch. The controls are well-executed and placed in a pragmatic position, in a way that I haven’t really seen anyone else achieve yet.

What else would one expect from Apple? :laughing:
