Theoretically they're the 2015 rankings in that they are published in 2015, but they're only for games released in 2014 ...

I find it interesting that only *one* of the major publishers had an average Metacritic rating of "Good", i.e. 75.0 or better. Given that I'll only look at a game that has below an 80.0 if I'm *desperate*, this isn't a great sign for the quality of games from 2014.
