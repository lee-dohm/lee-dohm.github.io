I'll give you three guesses, but you'll only need one ...

> The vast majority of the infected were unvaccinated against the disease, including kids who were too young for the shots and anti-vaxxers who chose against them. That's how you get an outbreak. But six of the cases got their measles-mumps-rubella vaccine&mdash;the MMR shot&mdash;and still managed to get infected. And all but two of them had gotten at least two doses, the standard recommendation.
