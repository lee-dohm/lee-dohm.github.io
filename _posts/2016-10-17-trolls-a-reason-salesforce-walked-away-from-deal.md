If you ever wondered if trolls hanging out on your service hurt your bottom line, look no further:

* "Salesforce stock plummeted after it was reported to be interested in buying Twitter"
* "a lot of the bidders are looking at people with lots of followers and seeing the hatred"
* "I know that the haters reduce the value of the company...I know that Salesforce was very concerned about this notion."

It's well known that many people just don't have time or inclination to deal with haters and emotional bullies. And _they shouldn't have to_. The number of people that don't want to deal with that crap is far, far larger than the number of crap-slingers. So which group of customers do you want to cater to?
