I just posted the current state of my [Atom Linguist project][atom-linguist] to GitHub. It currently supports classifying files based on file extension, full file name or by [shebang line][shebang]. I hope that it is going to be changing rapidly but don't let that stop you from giving feedback on the [Issues page][issues]!
