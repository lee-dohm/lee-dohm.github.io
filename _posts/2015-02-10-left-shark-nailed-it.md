> "The sharks were given two main objectives," Perry's choreographer RJ Durell tells THR. "One, perform Katy's trademark moves to the 'Teenage Dream' chorus, which they both did perfectly; and two, to have loads of fun, and bring to life these characters in a cartoon manner, giving them a Tweedledee/Tweedledum-type persona."

Personally, I think it's awesome that it was intentional. The cynical and jaded part of me is suggesting that it is all retconning, but I'm telling that part of me to shut up. Go Left Shark go!
