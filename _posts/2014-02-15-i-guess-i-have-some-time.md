For quite some time I've worried that as I get older I'm less and less likely to do something really great. We all dream of doing great things when we're young. My problem is that I never really had anything to focus me in one direction, so I've spent a lot of my life going from one thing to the next. I've never settled down and worked on [one thing](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/curlys-law-do-one-thing.html) long enough to really have any sort of magical breakthrough. Today, I stumbled across an article that says that [the most common time for people to have major creative breakthroughs is in their late thirties](http://qz.com/177694/why-major-creative-breakthroughs-happen-in-your-late-thirties/). According to the charts and statements in the article, it seems that there's plenty of chance for earth shattering ideas even into the forties and fifties. Now, what was I working on again ... ?
