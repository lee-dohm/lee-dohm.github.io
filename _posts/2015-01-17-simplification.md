My latest effort in my life is to make things simpler. I want to push all the distractions out of the way and just cut to the heart of the matter. I'm trying to do this in a lot of different areas of my life, so I figured why not here on the blog too? I tried to pare the content down to the bare essentials ... title, dateline, permalink, text.

I hope it makes the blog easier to navigate to find what you want.
