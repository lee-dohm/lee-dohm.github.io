> Watching people on the internet hunting for "unethical videogame journalism" is like watching a gas-poisoned family poke around their house, desperately in search of the source of the fumes. Oh, and did I mention that every member of the family is blind? Because apparently they are. How else could they miss the giant pipe coming from the kitchen wall that says "POISON GAS THAT MAKES YOU STUPID THEN KILLS YOU" written in sparkling bling on the side?
