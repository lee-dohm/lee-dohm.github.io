> Itâ€™s never a good sign when you have to declare during a debate that "I really am not a maniac."

The FBI continues to peddle its stance that the only way to prevent crime and terrorism is for *all* citizens to give up protecting their data from those who would take it from them, legally or illegally. This time the government is saying that we don't have to trust *them* with the keys to our respective kingdoms, just let the corporations have them. I'm sure that there will never be a [disgruntled employee that will steal customer data from the company](http://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-warns-of-rise-in-disgruntled-employees-stealing-data-1411516389). I'm sure that an employee of some company will *never* be careless with data, [allowing it to get stolen along with a company laptop](https://www.secpoint.com/theft-of-laptop-sends-people-to-panic.html).

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You know who is not going to protect my data as tenaciously as I will? Literally anyone *other* than me. The more people that have access to my data, the more likely it will be compromised. It is *that* simple. I don't care if that other party is the government, a corporation or the lady down the street (though I'm sure she's a really nice person).
