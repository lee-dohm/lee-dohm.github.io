[A new study][study] published by [PLOS ONE][plos-one] says that those who weren't obese and were subjected to weight discrimination were over 2.5 times more likely to become obese and those who were already obese were over three times more likely to *remain* obese. I'd say that pretty much puts the whole "stigmatize or not" debate to rest.
