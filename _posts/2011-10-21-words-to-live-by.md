A story I heard somewhere ...

> A vegetarian friend of mine told me that I'm not "evolved" because I eat meat.  He said people only started eating cows thousands of years ago because they were savages, they were barbarians and they didn't know any better.  People who eat cows now are not evolved.  What a bunch of bullshit.  People ate cows thousands of years ago for the same reason we eat cows today.  Because they are easy to catch.  We're not savages, we're just lazy.  A cheetah could taste like chocolate heroin, we'll never know.  Those little bastards are fast!

I love the idea of "tasting like chocolate heroin" and look for ways to work the phrase into casual conversation.
