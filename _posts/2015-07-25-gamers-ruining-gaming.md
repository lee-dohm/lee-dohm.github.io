According to this new rumor, the long-awaited next installment in the hugely popular [Half-Life series](http://valvesoftware.com/games/hl2.html) from [Valve](http://valvesoftware.com/) *may never be released*. The two reasons are, essentially:

1. Valve makes just as much money from their other properties as they would from releasing Half-Life 3
1. If Half-Life 3 is _**even perceived to be less than perfect**_, there *could be* a huge backlash from their "fans" up to and including threats and/or physical attacks and other terror tactics (such as [doxxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing), [SWATting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting), etc)

Personally, I find #1 to be very plausible but #2 is the most interesting. Essentially, a subsection of gamer culture has become *so toxic* that one of the largest and most talented game developers is, if the rumor is true, deciding to possibly *no longer make games* and simply relegate themselves to serving as a platform for others to sell their games upon. Because it is safer. Because some gamers act like terrorists.

You know what? If the rumor is true ... I don't blame them.
