I just read [a great article][article] that has summarized a lot of ideas I've had over the years, though have not always put into practice. I consider myself a very moral person and loyal as well. I've often been the quintessential "company man" ... at least for the first months or years at a company. The first thing I do when I join a new company or team is drink the Kool-Aid. That tendency has faded slowly over the past couple decades though. And I hope I'm finally rid of it. Because really, unless you work for yourself, then you should be working to live ... not living to work.
