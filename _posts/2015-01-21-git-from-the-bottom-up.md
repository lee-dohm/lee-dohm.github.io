The absolute bar none best tutorial I've seen on Git. Git has a horrible user interface in that it requires you to understand the physical model at a fairly detailed level in order to get it to do what you want. This online book helps you understand and internalize the physical model so that you can really get Git to go where you want it to. Every developer that uses Git on a regular basis should read it.
