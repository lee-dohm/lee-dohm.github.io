Come **on**! If even Gamergate's supporters are saying this guy scares them ... why haven't the police arrested this man yet? What is law enforcement for but to serve and **protect**!

I've got so many more thoughts about this transformation of our nation's law enforcement organizations from "citizens on patrol" into soldiers fighting a hypothetical "war". And I think that shift in mindset has negatively impacted functions such as these ... the very functions that our police, sheriffs, troopers and marshalls were originally intended to perform. But I am literally *seething* with anger right now ... I'm going to have to write it up later when I have a clearer head.
