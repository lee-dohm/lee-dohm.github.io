If you want an intelligent analysis of the forces that have created the GamerGate "movement" as well as an explanation of the critical thinking tools used to perform that analysis, [this video][video] is the one you've been looking for. It skillfully breaks down the world view of the GamerGate crowd and why the reaction to women and other minorities in games has been so vitriolic and hateful. The opening line, "GamerGate's base assumptions create a world view that justifies harassment and terrorism." Best ... explanation ... ever.
