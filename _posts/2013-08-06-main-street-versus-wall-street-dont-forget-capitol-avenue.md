[Techdirt][techdirt] posted [a story][story] today that talks about a revelation that Colorado lawmakers get issued special license plates that make them invisible to traffic cameras and parking tickets. You know, now that this is public, I wouldn't be surprised if some enterprising individual came up with a way to steal or otherwise appropriate one or more of these plates.
